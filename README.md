Electron emission fitter
========================
This software gathers several electron emission models.
They can be fitted on data files (generally experimental).

Two types of outputs can be generated:
- Text files holding the different emission yields at different impact angles/impact energies.
- Electron emission models parameters.

Scope
=====
Low-energies (multipactor)
Discrimination of secondary, backscattered
