EEmiLib
=======
EEmiLib (Electron EMIssion Library) holds several electron emission models and offers a simple way to fit the on electron emission data.
It is focused on electron emission models for multipactor simulation, *i.e.* for impinging energies ranging from few eV to several hundreds of eV.

Two types of outputs can be generated:
- Text files holding the different emission yields at different impact angles/impact energies.
- Electron emission models parameters.

Scope
=====
Low-energies (multipactor)
Discrimination of secondary, backscattered
