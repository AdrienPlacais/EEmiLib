Electron emission fitter
========================
This library offers a way to fit several electron emission models on electron emission data.
Two types of outputs can be generated:
- Text files holding the different emission yields at different impact angles/impact energies.
- Electron emission models parameters.

Scope
=====
Low-energies (multipactor)
Discrimination of secondary, backscattered

Roadmap
=======

`v0.1.0`
--------
Roadmap is finished.
It defines, for each version, the functionalities to implement as well as expected behaviors.
