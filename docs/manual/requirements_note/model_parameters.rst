Model parameters
""""""""""""""""
A first box retaining the value is filled in by the `Fit!` button, but user can change it manually.
Two cases define lower/upper values, which can be infinity (to deactivate limit).
Default value comes from associated paper, but can be modified by user.

`Fit!`
""""""
The `Fit!` button will fit the model parameters on the given data.
It fills in the values of the models parameters.

`Plot`
""""""
This button plots the data from measurement files, and on top of it the modelled data (dashed).
Vaughan will only plot the TEEY, but Dionne 3D will create TEEY, EBEEY, IBEEY, SEEY on the same plot, and angular distribution, and energy distribution.
If relatable, the figure should hold an angle and/or energy box where we can set what we want to plot.

`Export tabulated`
""""""""""""""""""
Saves tabulated modelled data in `Output folder`.
Proper format?

`Save model parameters`
"""""""""""""""""""""""
Saves model parameters in `Output folder`.
Proper format?
