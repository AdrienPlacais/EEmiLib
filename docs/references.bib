   abstract = {Mathematical expressions for the secondary emission yield as a function of impact voltage and direction are required by computer programs for ray tracing, and are intended to follow secondary trajectories also. It is shown that the accuracy requirements are quite severe for lower voltage impacts, up to about three times V_max (where V_max is the voltage at which the normal secondary emission ratio reaches its maximum value delta_max), but are less stringent above this range. A new formula is proposed for the low-voltage region, which agrees with experimental data better than the Lye and Dekker formula. For the voltage region above 4 V_max, the Lye and Dekker formula is retained, with a smooth transition centered between 3 and 4 V_max. The directional effect is modeled by adjusting the values of delta_max and V_max before applying either formula, rather than applying either Bruinings or Mullers correction factor afterward. This results in an automatic modeling of the known absence of any appreciable directional effect below about half V_max. Some experimental verification of the formula used to modify delta_max is presented.},
